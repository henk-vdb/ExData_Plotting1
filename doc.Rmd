# Exploratory Data Analysis

This page shows the 4 graphs of the assignment. There was some [discussion](https://class.coursera.org/exdata-011/forum/thread?thread_id=24) 
about the background of the images. The original images (the ones on the project website,
as well as the ones in the folder 'figure' in the forked project) have a transparrent background.

The discussion may be about peanuts, anyway I made mine transparrent, so ...  
On a white background the transparrent background of the files shows white again.
